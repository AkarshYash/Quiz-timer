# requirements.txt for Tech Quizathon Buzzer (Tkinter + Pygame)
# pip install -r requirements.txt

pygame>=2.1.0

# Notes:
# - tkinter is part of the Python standard library (on most installs). Do NOT include it here.
# - If you're on Linux, you may need system packages for SDL (the backend used by pygame).
# - If you want deterministic builds, pin exact versions (e.g. pygame==2.1.3).

# Example (optional):
# pygame==2.1.3
